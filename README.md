# Credit_Engine

  The credit engine is used in loan management systems. The main role of a credit engine is to identify the eligibility of the customer to get a loan. If the customer is eligible then how much loan can we provide them? All these can be done with the help of features like credit score, delinquency in last tenure(6, 12 & 36 months), average bank balance maintained, salary declared or identified etc. Every time we receive an application for loan in the Credit Engine we will pull credit bureau report of the customer and do provide the eligibility of the customer and loan amount if he is eligible. I have developed and still maintaining the credit engines of many fintech partnerships. Some of them are best fintech companies in India.
