# Credit_Engine
The credit engine is used in loan management systems. The main role of a credit engine is to identify the eligibility of the customer to get a loan. If the customer is eligible then how much loan can we provide them? All these can be done with the help of features like credit score, days past due in last tenure(6, 12 & 36 months), average bank balance maintained, salary declared or identified etc. So for the development of the credit engine we have used past data and supervised learning techniques. We have developed and trained a machine learning model using logistic regression.<br>
My Role: Data cleaning and processing, removing outliers, selecting suitable model and training the machine learning model, deploying package in AWS Lambda, testing the accuracy level with different scenarios.
